So here are my solutions to the challenges presented @ freeCodeCamp. I think I can get it better, but right now I'm pretty happy with it. The last one (cash register) was pretty hard, I couldn't finished it, but I guess is ok, I have plenty of time to do it still :P 
Overall, I'm really happy with this :) Enjoy!
